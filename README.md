# Fhysics

This project is a physics engine implemented in Kotlin. It provides functionality for handling object collisions, border collisions, and gravity. The engine uses a QuadTree data structure for efficient collision detection and resolution. It also includes a UI for easier user interactions and visual elements.

## Status

This project is currently `in development`. The engine is functional and can be used to simulate physics in a 2D environment. Future updates will include additional features and optimizations.

### Why the Name

As a big Star Wars fan, I initially wanted to call it "Force-Physics," but that felt too lengthy. Inspired by NVIDIA's "PhysX" engine, I decided to shorten it while maintaining the phonetic sound of "physics." Hence, "Fhysics" was born.
